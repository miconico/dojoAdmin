            At a CoderDojo, young people learn how to code, develop websites, apps, programs, games and more.
            Dojos are set up, run by and taught at by volunteers. Dojos organise tours of technology companies,
            bring in guest speakers to talk about their career and what they do, and organise events.
            In addition to learning to code, members meet like minded people, show off what they’ve been working on and so on.
            CoderDojo makes development and learning to code a fun, sociable, kick ass experience.
            CoderDojo also puts a strong emphasis on open source and free software, and has a strong network of members and volunteers globally.
